This makes them excellent value for larger portfolios but potentially expensive for smaller ones. Percentage fee brokers (like AJ Bell or Fidelity) charge a percentage of your portfolio value, typically 0.15%–0.45%. This is cheaper for smaller portfolios but costs more as your investments grow. There's also a third category: zero-fee brokers (like InvestEngine or Trading 212) that don't charge platform fees. They typically make money through FX spreads, securities lending, or offering a more limited range of investments."

For Interactive Investor (Core at £71.88/yr) vs a 0.25% fee broker, the crossover is around £29,000."

This covers the platform going bust — not your investments falling in value (that's market risk). Your actual investments (shares, funds, etc.) are held separately from the broker's own assets in nominee accounts, so even if the broker fails, your investments should be safe. FSCS is a backstop for the unlikely scenario where there's fraud or administrative failure. If your portfolio exceeds £85,000, consider splitting across brokers with different FSCS entities for maximum protection."

The most notable example: Lloyds Bank, Halifax, Bank of Scotland, and Scottish Widows all share the same FSCS investment protection entity. If you have £85,000 with Lloyds and £85,000 with Halifax, you do NOT have £170,000 of FSCS cover — it's £85,000 combined."

SIPP (Self-Invested Personal Pension): Pension wrapper with tax relief on contributions (20–45% depending on your tax band). Can't access until age 57 (rising to 58 in 2028). 25% tax-free lump sum on withdrawal. GIA (General Investment Account): Standard investment account with no tax wrapper. Subject to capital gains tax and income tax on dividends. No contribution limits. JISA (Junior ISA): Tax-free ISA for under-18s. £9,000 annual allowance. Child can access at 18. LISA (Lifetime ISA): For ages 18–39. £4,000 annual allowance with 25% government bonus. Can be used for first home purchase or retirement (age 60). 25% penalty for other withdrawals."

Since April 2024, you can contribute to multiple Stocks & Shares ISAs in the same tax year, subject to the overall £20,000 annual ISA allowance. For SIPPs, you can have multiple, and there's no limit on how many you contribute to in a year (subject to your annual pension allowance). Splitting across brokers can make sense for FSCS protection diversification, or to take advantage of different brokers' strengths."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "An in-specie transfer means moving your actual investments (shares, funds, etc.) from one broker to another without selling them first. This avoids triggering capital gains tax events and means you stay invested during the transfer. The alternative is a cash transfer: selling everything, transferring the cash, and rebuying. This means you're out of the market during the transfer (typically 2–6 weeks) and may crystallise taxable gains. Most major brokers support in-specie transfers, but some newer platforms (like InvestEngine) do not allow in-specie transfers out."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Platform fees (also called custody or management fees) are what the broker charges you for holding your investments. This is either a flat annual fee or a percentage of your portfolio value. Trading fees are charged each time you buy or sell an investment. These range from £0 (free trading) to £10+ per trade. Many brokers offer free regular investing even if ad-hoc trades cost money. FX fees are charged when you buy investments denominated in a foreign currency. The broker converts your GBP and takes a spread, typically 0.15%–1.5%."

It's deducted automatically from the fund's value, so you don't see a separate charge. A typical global index fund has an OCF of 0.10%–0.25%. Actively managed funds can charge 0.50%–1.50%.

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Zero-fee brokers aren't charities. Common revenue sources include: FX spreads (charging a markup on currency conversions), securities lending (lending your shares to short-sellers and keeping a portion of the interest), premium plans (free basic tier with paid plans offering lower FX rates or more features), and interest on cash balances (earning interest on uninvested cash in your account). This doesn't mean free brokers are bad — many offer genuine value. Just be aware of the trade-offs, especially around investment range and FX costs."

        "text": "Fees compound just like returns — but in reverse. A seemingly small difference in fees has a massive impact over decades. Example: £500/month invested over 30 years at 7% growth: With 0.15% total fees: ~£556,000. With 0.50% total fees: ~£509,000. With 1.00% total fees: ~£453,000.

        "text": "We aim to update fees whenever a major broker changes their pricing. The last update was February 2026, incorporating changes from October 2025 and early 2026. Broker fees change periodically, so always verify current fees directly with your chosen provider before making decisions."

        "text": "No. BrokerFinder is an informational tool to help you research and compare broker costs. It is not regulated financial advice and should not be treated as such. The tool helps you understand the cost of different platforms, but choosing a broker involves many factors we can't fully account for: your tax situation, existing investments, employer pension arrangements, risk tolerance, and more. If you're unsure, consider speaking to a qualified independent financial adviser (IFA)."

        <p>The <strong>OCF</strong> is the annual cost of owning a fund or ETF, charged by the fund manager (not your broker). It's deducted automatically from the fund's value, so you don't see a separate charge.</p>
        <p>A typical global index fund has an OCF of 0.10%&ndash;0.25%. Actively managed funds can charge 0.50%&ndash;1.50%. Over decades, even small differences in OCF compound into enormous differences in returns.</p>
        <p>Use our <a href="/calculator/">compound interest calculator</a> to see how different OCF levels affect your long-term wealth.</p>

        Are "free" brokers really free? How do they make money?

        <p>Zero-fee brokers aren't charities. Common revenue sources include:</p>
        <p><strong>FX spreads:</strong> Charging a markup on currency conversions (even InvestEngine charges FX on non-GBP ETFs via the spread).</p>
        <p><strong>Securities lending:</strong> Lending your shares to short-sellers and keeping a portion of the interest (Trading 212, Freetrade).</p>
        <p><strong>Premium plans:</strong> Free basic tier with paid plans offering lower FX rates or more features (Freetrade, Revolut).</p>
        <p><strong>Interest on cash balances:</strong> Earning interest on uninvested cash in your account.</p>
        <p>This doesn't mean free brokers are bad &mdash; many offer genuine value. Just be aware of the trade-offs, especially around investment range and FX costs.</p>

        What is the impact of fees on long-term returns?

        <p>Fees compound just like returns &mdash; but in reverse. A seemingly small difference in fees has a massive impact over decades.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> &pound;500/month invested over 30 years at 7% growth:</p>
        <p>With 0.15% total fees: ~&pound;556,000<br>With 0.50% total fees: ~&pound;509,000<br>With 1.00% total fees: ~&pound;453,000</p>
        <p>That's a <strong>&pound;103,000 difference</strong> between 0.15% and 1% fees. The money didn't disappear &mdash; it went to the platform and fund managers instead of compounding in your portfolio.</p>
